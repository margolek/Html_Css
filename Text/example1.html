	<h1>The Project Gutenberg eBook, How They Succeeded, by Orison Swett Marden
	</h1>
	<p><q>There were no fine libraries</q> then, but in <abbr title = 'Allengheny City'>AC</abbr>, where I lived, there was a certain Colonel Anderson, who was well to do and of a philanthropic turn. He announced, about the time I first began to work, that he would be in his library at home, every <b>Saturday</b>, ready to lend books to <cite>working</cite> boys and men. He had only about four hundred volumes, but I doubt if ever so few books were put to better use.
